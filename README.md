# Physics-Collision-Simulator

This is a Coding Challenge where I attempt to try and code a Collision simulation using the law of conservation of momentum. This Project is avalible on :  

Here there are two blocks which collide with each other having a perfectly elastic collision :

Elastic collision of masses in a system with a moving frame of reference

## Equations

Consider particles 1 and 2 with masses m1, m2, and velocities u1, u2 before collision, v1, v2 after collision.

The conservation of the total momentum before and after the collision is expressed by:

Likewise, the conservation of the total kinetic energy is expressed by:

These equations may be solved directly to find v1, v2 when u1, u2 are known:

This simply corresponds to the bodies exchanging their initial velocities to each other.
